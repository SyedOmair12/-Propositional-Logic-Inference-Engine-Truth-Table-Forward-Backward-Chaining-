# Propositional-Logic-Inference-Engine-Truth-Table-Forward-Backward-Chaining-
Developed a command-line inference engine for propositional logic that determines whether a given query can be logically entailed from a Horn-form knowledge base using:

Truth Table Checking (TT)

Forward Chaining (FC)

Backward Chaining (BC)

The engine parses a .txt file containing TELL (knowledge base) and ASK (query) statements and outputs whether the query is entailed. The engine also outputs the model count (TT) or the entailed propositions (FC/BC) on success.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
Custom parser for logic statements and file input

Full implementation of TT, FC, and BC algorithms based on AIMA (3rd Edition)

Batch execution using command-line arguments (e.g., iengine FC test1.txt)

Generates YES/NO outputs with detailed tracing of inference steps

Robust handling of Horn clauses and logical implications
